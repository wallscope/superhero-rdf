# Superhero RDF Dataset

This dataset was created to illustrate OntoRefine in an article [here](https://medium.com/@addlesee/using-ontorefine-to-transform-tabular-data-into-linked-data-7277ec8c2c0f).

The data is found in the data directory.

The original tabular dataset was downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set).

This data was then again used in my article titled [Constructing More Advanced SPARQL Queries](https://medium.com/@addlesee/constructing-more-advanced-sparql-queries-72d5ade1eedc)
